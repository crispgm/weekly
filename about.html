      <p>
        Crisp Programming Weekly is a weekly with curated tech articles, which is published every one or two weekly or even for longer time (depends on the progress of collection). The original weekly could be tracked back to <a href="https://msbu-tech.github.io/weekly/">MSBU Tech Weekly</a>, which is my former team and it has declared dissolution since the beginning of 2017. The goal of the weekly is to collect awesome tech articles to share with the whole dev team. And now, I took over the weekly, collect, and publish by myself.

      <p>
        Articles before Feb 10th, 2017 were collected from all the team, including @RichardJing @langjun @haharazer @regrex @hzphust. Thanks to their great efforts, our weekly could be in wide horizons, from backend to frontend, app development, and even more.

        The articles are typically collected from HackerNews, Medium, Wanqu and occasionally from Juejin and Twitter, which are either in English or in Chinese. And I prefer article in its original language to translation.

        The collecting and building process is in automation. <a href="https://crispgm.com/page/engineering-weekly-automation.html">I wrote a post on it on my blog</a>.
